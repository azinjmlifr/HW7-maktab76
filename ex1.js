/*Ex.1
Your task is to create a Circle constructor that creates a circle with
 a radius provided by an argument. The circles constructed must have 
 two methods getArea() (PI*r^2) and getPerimeter() (2*PI*r) which 
 give both respective areas and perimeter (circumference).

  this.radius = radius;

  this.getPerimeter = (radius) => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius;
}

let q = new Circle(4.44);
console.log(q.getArea());
console.log(q.getPerimeter());
